This is an example WRT Buildroot Manager project.

It was created by doing the following:

    cd path/to/wrt-buildroot-manager
    ./configure.sh
    source wrt-buildroot-manager.source
    
    cd
    
    wrt-project create wbm-carambola2-1407
    cd wbm-carambola2-1407

and then editing README.md, custom.config, feeds.config, packages.txt and files/ to create a bespoke
[Carambola2](http://8devices.com) OpenWRT firmware against Barrier Breaker.
